/* Program to install SAS data sets into the SASUSER library.
   
   These data sets are associated with the book
     Wicklin, R. (2010),

   1. Put the Zip file in the SAS/IML Studio "Personal Files Directory" (PFD).
   2. Extracted the contents of the Zip file into the PFD.
   3. Determined that SAS/IML Studio and the SAS Workspace Server are on the same PC.

/* Program to install SAS data sets into a user-defined library named "SPI." 
   
   These data sets are associated with the book
     Wicklin, R. (2010),
     Statistical Programming with SAS/IML Software,
     Cary, NC: SAS Press.
     
   This program assumes that you have already completed the following
   steps as described in the file README_How_To_Install.txt:
   1. Put the Zip file in the SAS/IML Studio "Personal Files Directory" (PFD).
   2. Extracted the contents of the Zip file into the PFD.
   3. Determined that SAS/IML Studio is comnnected to a remote SAS Workspace Server.
   
   The program also assumes that your site administrator has used the 
   SAS Management Console to set up a data library named "SPI" on the remote server.
